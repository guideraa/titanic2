Few Minor Adjustments</font></p>
<p align="left" style="background: #eeeeee"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">The
last sentence of the previous page stated: “<font color="#0066b3"><i>the
Data Scientist can just continue to write her/his code as before with
only </i></font><font color="#0066b3"><i><b>minor adjustments</b></i></font><font color="#0066b3"><i>.</i></font>”.
 In this page we will discuss those “minor adjustments”.  </font>

<p align="left" style="background: #eeeeee"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">First
we need to understand the simple protocol that software developers
use to facilitate communication between the web application and its
components ( eg. DS Model code ).  Since the DS Model module is
decoupled, it has to have some way to receive from the web
application the features and labels that it will use in the model. 
We do not want to hard-code in those values since that would make the
module inflexible. Also, the module needs some way of returning the
trained model as well as a prediction based on prediction data that
the user provides.  </font>
</p>
<p align="left" style="background: #eeeeee"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">So
we will make use of a protocol that software developers use to solve
the problem of communication with a decoupled module.  The protocol
is called “Application Program Interface”, or simply API. 
<i>Implementation of API’s does not involve new technology.</i> 
Implementation of API’s is simply arranging your code so that it
conforms to a simple standard.  In fact, for our demo purposes we can
say that our API’s will just be functions or methods of a class
that can be called by API consumers.  These API’s will have a
documented list of parameters that are passed to the function and a
documented list of values that the function will return.</font></p>
